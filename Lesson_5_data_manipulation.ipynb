Column Names: The DataFrames should have the same column names. If the column names differ between the DataFrames, you may encounter issues during appending. If you want to keep columns that are only present in one of the DataFrames, you can set the ignore_index parameter to True, which will reset the index.\n","\n","2. Column Order: The order of columns should be the same in both DataFrames. If the column order differs, you may need to re-order the columns before appending.\n","\n","3. Index: By default, when appending, the index from each DataFrame is retained. If you want to create a new index or reset the index, you can use the ignore_index parameter and set it to True.\n","\n","4. Data Types: Column data types should be compatible. If there are differences in data types, pandas will attempt to cast the data to a common type. If a column cannot be cast, it may result in an error.\n","\n","5. Missing Data: If one of the DataFrames has missing data in certain columns, the appended DataFrame will have NaN values in those columns for rows where data is missing.\n","\n","6. Duplicates: If there are duplicate rows between the DataFrames, these duplicates will be retained in the appended DataFrame. If you want to remove duplicates, you can use the drop_duplicates() method after appending.\n","\n","Note that pandas also has the  \n","\n","    pd.append()\n","    \n","method which is similar to pd.concat(). It's an alternative to the pd.concat() function and provides a more concise way to combine two DataFrames. However, the rules and considerations for appending DataFrames using append() are quite similar to those for pd.concat():\n","\n","\n","### Merge\n","\n","We can also merge DataFrames horizontally in pandas.
